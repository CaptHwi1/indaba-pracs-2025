# Deep Learning Indaba Practicals 2025

This year, we are introducing a new format for our practicals.  

Each practical will now be split into multiple parts:  
- **Part 1**: The first and main session will take place during the Indaba event.  
- **Parts 2â€“4**: The remaining sessions will be remotely delivered after the conference. 

As always, all of our practicals are available in both English and French.

## Part 1

### Day 1

| Topic ðŸ’¥ | Description ðŸ“˜ |
|:--|:--|
| **ML Foundations**  \|  [Notebook](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2025/blob/main/practicals/ML_Foundation/Part_1/Introduction_to_Deep_Learning.ipynb)  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2025/blob/main/practicals/ML_Foundation/Part_1/Introduction_to_Deep_Learning.ipynb) | Explore the fundamental concepts behind deep learning, from data and models to loss functions and optimization. Build a neural network from scratch with NumPy, then learn how to scale to larger models efficiently using JAX. Along the way, youâ€™ll understand key ML terminology, types of ML problems, and the basics of supervised learning. This beginner-friendly session assumes basic NumPy and functional programming knowledge. |
| **Generative AI**  \|  [Notebook](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2025/blob/main/practicals/Generative_AI/Part_1/Exploring_the_World_of_GenAI.ipynb)  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2025/blob/main/practicals/Generative_AI/Part_1/Exploring_the_World_of_GenAI.ipynb) | Explore the fast-evolving world of Generative AI, from creative tools and media to science and simulation. Learn about core generative model types (GANs, VAEs, diffusion, flow-matching, autoregressive), experiment with AI-powered image generation and augmentation, test your ability to tell real from AI-generated images, and reflect on key ethical issues such as bias, ownership, and responsible innovation. No coding experience is required for this first session, though later Generative AI practicals will assume familiarity with coding and linear algebra. |

| **LLMs**  \|  [Notebook](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2025/blob/main/practicals/LLMs/Part_1/Intro_to_LLM.ipynb)  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2025/blob/main/practicals/LLMs/Part_1/Intro_to_LLM.ipynb) | A hands-on introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs), covering how to load and interact with pre-trained models, the fundamentals of the Transformer architecture, tokenization and embeddings, and training a simplified LLM from scratch. Explore real-world applications in code generation, creative writing, and question answering, and analyze how tokenization impacts usage costs across languages. Suitable for beginner to intermediate learners with basic deep learning, NLP, and linear algebra knowledge. |
| **Reinforcement Learning**  \|  [Notebook](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2025/blob/main/practicals/Reinforcement_Learning/Part_1/Solving_the_Snake_game_using_RL.ipynb)  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2025/blob/main/practicals/Reinforcement_Learning/Part_1/Solving_the_Snake_game_using_RL.ipynb) | Learn to train an AI agent to play the Snake game from scratch using policy-based Reinforcement Learning. Start with simple parameterized policies and random search, then progress to understanding policy gradients and implementing the classic REINFORCE algorithm. By the end, youâ€™ll be able to define and code a policy, explore its limitations, and train an agent to act effectively in a dynamic environment. Requires basic Python, NumPy, JAX, and ML fundamentals. |
